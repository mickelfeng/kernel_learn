### reveng_rtkit mechanism:

![](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/main/reveng_rtkit_mechanism.jpeg?raw=true)

### <ins>Rootkit features</ins>:

| Sl. no. | Name | Features |
| ------- | ------- | -------- | 
| 1. | Finding Syscall Table address | By creating custom kallsyms_lookup_name function to get <ins>address</ins> of `sys_call_table` symbol from kernel memory. |
| 2. | Function Hooking | Get the <ins>address</ins> of the `syscall` from `sys_call_table` to get them hooked, then `modify CR0 register` to <ins>remove write protect bit</ins> and then modify/edit the `sys_call_table` and then again <ins>applying write protection to kernel memory</ins>. |
| 3. | Hide Rootkit | Hides itself by deleting itself(or entry) from responsible linked list. |
| 4. | Hide Processes/implants | Done in same way, as mentioned above in Sl. no. 2. |
| 5. | Unable to rmmod rootkit module | Using kernel function called `try_module_get()` makes impossible for admins to remove our rootkit. |
| 6. | Interactive Control | Implementing an IOCTL which manages the features of the rootkit and allows the user to send it commands. |
| 7. | Bypassing | Can bypass infamous [rkhunter](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Rkhunter) antirootkit |

### Let's see what functions will be called during loading the rootkit:

| Defined within Filename | Functions | function name in rootkit.c | Working | Effectivity of remove_rootkit() | Mode of access | 
| ----------------------- | --------- | -------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -- | 
| hide_show_helper.h | proc_lsmod_hide_rootkit() | hide_rootkit() | Hides rootkit from _"/proc/modules"_ file, _"/proc/kallsyms"_ file and "lsmod" command. | No effectivity | ./client_usermode | 
| hide_show_helper.h | sys_module_hide_rootkit() | hide_rootkit() | Hides rootkit from  "/sys/module/<THIS_MODULE>/" directory. | No effectivity | ./client_usermode | 
| hide_show_helper.h | proc_lsmod_show_rootkit() | show_rootkit() | Reveals our rootkit in _"/proc/modules"_ file, _"/proc/kallsyms"_ file and "lsmod" command. | Will work effectively | ./client_usermode | 
| hide_show_helper.h | sys_module_show_rootkit() | show_rootkit() | Reveals our rootkit in "/sys/module/<THIS_MODULE>/" directory. | _ | ./client_usermode |
| rootkit.c | tidy() | tidy() | In this function we do some clean up. If we don't do this, there will be some errors during unloading the rootkit using `rmmod`. | _ | _ |
| rootkit.c | protect_rootkit() | protect_rootkit() | This is very simple function which just makes impossible to unload the rootkit by "rmmod rootkit" command even if it is visible. However it is still possible to unload by "rmmod -f rootkit" if kernel was compiled with support for forced unloading modules. &nbsp; link: [sysprog21.github.io](https://sysprog21.github.io/lkmpg/#building-modules-for-a-precompiled-kernel) | _ | ./client_usermode | 
| rootkit.c | remove_rootkit() | remove_rootkit() | Making rootkit removable from kernel using rmmod | _ | ./client_usermode |
| hook_syscall_helper.h | hacked_kill() | rootkit_init() and rootkit_exit(void) | Process/Implant Hiding | _ | cmd prompt: kill -31 \<pid> |
| hook_syscall_helper.h | hacked_kill() | rootkit_init() and rootkit_exit(void) | getting rootshell | _ | cmd prompt: kill -64 \<any pid> |

### NOTE:
> **Function tidy(), sys_module_hide_rootkit() and sys_module_show_rootkit() are not used in code. They were commented out. The reason behind that will be discussed in details in my blog post.**

### How to use it:
1. Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit.git
```
2. Enter the directory
```
$ cd reveng_rtkit/
```
3. Now, we have 2 directories: kernel_src and user_src.
- user_src:
Contains `usermode client code` to interact with our rootkit module (once it it loaded into the kernel) via the registered Character Device file.
- kernel_src:
Contains `kernelmode rootkit: reveng_rtkit` which will be responsible for the whole mayhem :wink:.

```
$ cd kernel_src/
$ make
$ sudo insmod reveng_rtkit.ko
```
![kernel_rootkit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61424547/161190087-eace0284-50ae-48e7-b9a9-d3dbf255837b.png)

4. To interract with the kernel rootkit. Open another terminal
```
$ cd reveng_rtkit/user_src/
```
5. compile and run the code
```
$ gcc client_usermode.c -o client_usermode
$ sudo ./client_usermode
```
#### NOTE: Be sure to run the code with root priv., because we are interracting with device driver, which is a part of the Linux kernel.

![client_mode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61424547/155754834-13bf9ee5-0bdd-4d30-af88-71a26a92dee8.png)

6. Another method to interract with it is via kill syscall interception:
- To hide process/implant:
```
$ kill -31 <pid>
```

- To get root shell (_without providing a password_):
```
$ kill -64 <any pid>
```

#### NOTE:
>  This rootkit is capable of providing rootshell to only bash and sh shell, not others. Although, it is possible for other shells as well but with some tricks. We can use system() C function alike function in Linux Kernel programming, so that we 1st trigger a bash/sh shell then offer rootshell to the attacker. I  have'nt got that type of kernel function till now, but as soon as I get it, I will add it up. If anybody viewing this know about this, or interested to contribute, are most welcome to make a pull request.

- To remove this rootkit module: 1stly make module visible via `show` command using client_usermode file as reveng_rtkit while loading hides itself from being revealed (also change to `remove` mode, if you have made rootkit module to `protect` mode previously).

### Bypassing ***rkhunter*** antirootkit:

Here is the log file, that was generated:

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/488606.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/488606)

- Only one warning is present:
1. /usr/bin/lwp-request : [stackexchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/373718/rkhunter-gives-me-a-warning-for-usr-bin-lwp-request-what-should-i-do-debi)
So, this is not a threat! cool!

### Update:
Today, I found out this ***Warning***.

![rootkit_warning](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61424547/200777350-10af0a77-efcc-4fff-9ba4-0580197045b5.png)

Then searched for other options of ***rkhunter*** to get more informations about this "**warning**", that which exact processes are actually causing this warning (`suspicious (large) shared memory segments`). Found out this:

![rootkit_warning_reasons](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61424547/200780076-dca793ac-b047-427c-8e3d-a6f3b55b4e51.png)

We can see it is telling us, `configured size allowed: 1.0MB`, i.e. those processes which takes more than 1MB gets flagged. But main point is our rootkit is not getting flagged :) (More like False-Positive thing).

There are several links related to this:
1. [serverfault](https://serverfault.com/questions/697865/rkhunter-suspicious-shared-memory-segments)
2. [linuxquestions](https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-security-4/rkhunter-gives-warnings-about-large-shared-memory-segments-and-a-few-strange-files-4175649554/)


### To-Do list :man_mechanic::
- Hiding process files completely. Our hidden process file can be accessed to open/read. If someone does, `ls <filename>`, they can easily open them.
- Successfully able to hide and reveal our LKM module from `/sys/module/` directory using sycall interception, in order to decieve usermode programs [issue #6](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/issues/6).
- Adding system() C function alike function in Linux Kernel programming, in order to open a new bash/sh prompt [issue #1](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/issues/1).
- Adding Linux Kernel Sockets [issue #2](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/issues/2).
- Surviving system reboot [issue #5](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/issues/5).
- Breaking `kernel_src/reveng_rtkit.c` [issue #8](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/issues/8).
- Adding Capabilty to `bypass SELinux enabled Linux System` [issue #9](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/issues/12).
- Bypassing `chkrootkit antirootkit` [issue #4](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/issues/4).
    - Getting detected by `chkrootkit antirootkit` till now, under `chkproc section`: [chkproc.c](https://github.com/Magentron/chkrootkit/blob/master/chkproc.c)

### Limitations:
- This LKM based rootkit can only be used in those Linux OSs, which don't have these two protections:
	1. Secure Boot
	2. Adding a grub parameter to "`/etc/default/grub`" file.
This thing was pointed out to me by [Artem Baranov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/artem-baranov-86163135) and this [link](https://blog.delouw.ch/2017/04/18/signing-linux-kernel-kodules-and-enforce-to-load-only-signed-modules/) was shared to me, on my linkedin post, by [Victor Sergeev](https://ae.linkedin.com/in/victor-sergeev/), for further research.

#### Detailed Blog article on ***reveng_rtkit*** LKM rootkit, is available [now](https://reveng007.github.io/blog/2022/03/08/reveng_rkit_detailed.html), where I have explained how I created this LKM rootkit step by step.
