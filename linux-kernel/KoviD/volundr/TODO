(sorted by priority)

- Turn shared libraries into proper API's
- properly allocate data structures into elfo & free them
- use config.h (to define ELF_*)
- extend file memory mapping
- replace all fread() (and friends) by memory mapping (mmap() and friends)
- log_trace && _TRACE
- consider creating elf_meta_*.
- autotools
- section to segment mapping (see readelf)
- change file_read to something more generic (consider reading from mem)
- store section names in meta data structure (create elf_read_all_shnames)
- make install / make evil_install
- use doxygen
- check nanming convention
- support section types: HASH, GNU_HASH, VERSYM, VERNEED, REL, DYNAMIC
- svn $Id$ + watermark
- implement ELF_DONTUSE_META (?)
- implement NOT_PARANOID mode (to drop most of funcs asserts)
  they are not that useful anyway.
- volatile ELF structure (will be changed on-the-fly)
- make non-gnu version (removing __attribute__, typeof, etc)
- remove complex and unecessary data structures/types
- "static" volundr
- extend asm syscalls implementations and make use of them



(future versions)

- kmem trick
- hash tables
- relocation algorithms/functionalities
- dynamic sections
- alignment constraints
- other injection tekneeqz!



(always-used)

- use elf_{word,half,off}_t types where appropriate.
- use design by contract comments in function descriptions. (please!)
